            <p>Sushi had been introduced to the West by the early 1900s, following Japanese immigration after the Meiji Restoration. However, it was not popular among anyone except the upper-class, and as Japanese immigration declined in the late 1900s, it became much less common.
                Sushi began becoming more popular again in the United States a few years after the conclusion of World War II, when Japan once again became open for international trade, tourism, and business. In the 1960s, this trend began to take hold in America in earnest, and middle-class Americans began trying sushi for themselves – and loving it.
                Like most elements of food history, there is a great deal of debate surrounding exactly which restaurant introduced sushi to Western Diners – and it’s really not possible to determine exactly who was responsible for doing so.
                However, Kawafuku Restaurant of Los Angeles is often credited with this honor – as it was one of the first restaurants to offer sushi. As you can imagine, though, the idea of eating raw fish took a little while to catch on in America – but by the late 1960s, sushi had become trendy, and new sushi restaurants were opening up all across the country.
                To help Americans get used to the idea of eating sushi, many restaurants began experimenting with new taste combinations and sushi rolls. One of the rolls that became the most popular among Americans was the now-ubiquitous California Roll, which is an inside-out “makizushi” roll with cucumber, crab meat (or imitation crab meat), and avocado with white rice.
                This flavor combination was instantly appealing to diners – and because the crab meat was cooked in the roll, diners didn’t have to be squeamish about eating raw fish – and as they got used to the idea, they were able to branch out into more traditional sashimi and nigiri dishes. Just like that, sushi restaurants became a national phenomenon.</p>
